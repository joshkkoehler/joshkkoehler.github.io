    <p>Upon first mention, duck can strike fear into even some well practiced home chefs.
      Although, duck really can be a simple dish. In it's true essence, it is no more than a miniature turkey.
      This guide will show you how to prepare and serve this food, conquering this so-called culinary challenge.</p>

    <p>There are many methods to thawing raw meat, some being much more effective than others.
      Certain people may lay the bird in the fridge, out on the counter, or even in a slightly warmed oven.
      By far, the most efficient way is to thaw submerged in slightly cold water.</p><br>
    <p>Air is not dense. Because of this, the counter, oven, and fridge are all rendered less effective in terms of thawing.
      When raw meat is surrounded by water, the water is better equipped to hold it's own temperature.
      This allows equilibrium between the temperature of the water and the temperature of the bird to be reached much quicker than any air thawing methods.</p>

    <p>By far, the best way to prepare a duck is in a brine. Because of a ducks thick and water resistant skin,
      a long brine will allow flavors to be absorbed throughout the meat instead of only on the surface.</p>
    <p>A brine always starts with two simple ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It is possible and quite encouraged to supplement or substitute the water for other liquids. Depending on the dish, you can use:
    <ul>
      <li>Juice</li>
      <li>Beer</li>
      <li>Wine</li>
      <li>Stock or Broth</li>
      <li>Tea</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For this dish, I enjoy orange or pineapple juice as the base for the brine. Depending on the size of your bird, you will probably need at least half a cup of salt.
      With that, you can add some fresh herbs like thyme or sage. And then simply stir to disolve the salt.</p>
    <p>In order to fully integrate the flavors of your brine into your bird, it is best to quarter it first. It also helps to slice just barely through the thick skin of the breasts.
      Once quartered, place your bird along with your brine into a ziplock bag and place in the fridge at least overnight.</p>

    <p>Although there are many methods of cooking duck, one of the best ways involves two parts.
      The first part which will cook the bird through and create a moist dish is to cook with steam.
      A steamer basket should be placed in a large put with an inch or two of water. Once the water is boiling gently and creating a good amount of steam, the duck can be placed in the basket.
      The pot can then be covered and steamed for about 45 minutes.</p>
    <p>After a long steam, a moist interior is retained, but the exterior unfortunately is also very moist. To fix this issue, a heavy cast iron pan should be placed in the oven at about 350 degrees.
      Place the duck in the pan skin side down and cook just long enough to crisp the skin,</p>

    <p>This dish can be served with a side of charred greens or simply enjoyed on it's own. Either way it will be enjoyed immensily by the cook or by the guests.
      Although challenging at first glance, duck really can be a simple but delicious dish.</p>
